# Creating a Diagnostic Tool to help Classifying Menatal Health Disorders

## The purpose of this project was to try to classify different mental health disorders according to textual data sourced from each disorders subreddit.
Using scraped text posts from six differenct subreddits r/depression, r/BPD, r/anxiety, r/bipolar, r/anxiety I implemented 3 machine learning mdoels and 2 nueral network classifyers to determiene mental health issues via text based machine learning methods.
